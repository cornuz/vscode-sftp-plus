# Changelog

All notable changes to the SFTP+ extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-11

### Added

- **💾 Original File Backup** - Server files are automatically backed up before any modification
  - Immutable snapshot stored in `.sftp-plus/originals/{connection}/`
  - Backup created on first edit only — never overwritten
  - Works across all entry points: AI tools, right-click Download, prepare_edit

- **🔄 New AI Tool: `get_sync_status`** - Returns sync status for all tracked files
  - Shows: synced / local-newer / remote-newer / not-downloaded
  - Includes file sizes, modification dates, and original backup status
  - Enables AI orchestrators to monitor batch operation progress

- **⏪ New AI Tool: `restore_original`** - Rollback to original server version
  - Restores the pre-modification backup to the local working copy
  - Original backup is preserved after restore for future reference

- **📊 File metadata in `list_files`** - Results now include `size` (bytes) and `modified` (ISO date) for each file

### Improved

- **🛡️ MCP Connection Stability**
  - Health check requires 3 consecutive failures before disconnecting (was 1)
  - Health check timeout increased from 3s to 5s
  - MCP suspend/resume: connection drops preserve AI write permissions
  - Auto-resume MCP on reconnection with all permissions intact
  - Drive accessibility retry (3 attempts × 2s) before failing
  - `TEMPORARY:` error messages guide AI agents to retry instead of abandoning
  - MCP state persisted in workspaceState across VS Code sessions

## [0.2.0] - 2026-01-29

### Added

- **🤖 GitHub Copilot Integration** - Copilot can now interact with your remote files!
  - Uses VS Code's Language Model Tools API (not an external MCP server)
  - Click the AI icon in the file browser to enable access per-host
  - **Local Mode** (green): Edit files locally with diff preview before uploading
  - **Host Mode** (red): Direct write access to remote server
  - 9 AI tools: `list_connections`, `list_files`, `read_file`, `write_file`, `prepare_edit`, `search_files`, `get_tree`, `list_writable_paths`, `request_write_access`

- **Automatic File Tracking** - Files in `.sftp-plus/` folder are automatically tracked on startup
  - No more manual Track/Untrack - the extension scans your local files automatically
  - Tracking data synced with `tracking.json`

- **Upload to Host Command** - Right-click local `.sftp-plus/` files to upload back to server
  - Available in Explorer context menu, editor context menu, and editor title
  - Automatically refreshes sync status after upload

### Changed

- **Sync Status Colors**:
  - Remote Newer: Red (`#ff0000`)
  - Local Newer: Blue (`#569cd6`)
  - Synced: Green (`#89d185`)
- **Sync Comparison Logic**: Same file size = Synced, different size = compare modification dates
- Extension display name changed to "SFTP+ MCP"

### Fixed

- FileTree now properly refreshes after download/upload operations
- Tracked files sync status updates immediately after file operations

## [0.1.5] - 2026-01-29

### Fixed

- **Critical: FTP/FTPS file sync issue** - Large files (>16KB) were not syncing to remote server
  - Root cause: FTP servers rejecting `.partial` temporary files during TLS uploads
  - Solution: Added `--inplace` flag to write directly to files without temporary files
  - This fix applies to all protocols (SFTP, FTP, FTPS)

### Added

- **Connection health monitoring** - Detects when connections are lost and updates UI automatically
  - Health check runs every 30 seconds via rclone RC API
  - Shows warning notification with "Reconnect" option when connection is lost
  - UI (tree view) updates immediately to reflect disconnected state

### Changed

- **Keep connections alive** - Changed default `idleTimeout` from `5m` to `0` (disabled)
  - Connections now stay open as long as VS Code is running
  - Can be overridden per-connection in settings if needed
- Improved FTP/FTPS connection reliability with additional rclone options:
  - `--inplace` - Write directly to files (all protocols)
  - `--low-level-retries 10` - More retries for network issues (all protocols)
  - `--ftp-disable-tls13` - Workaround for buggy TLS implementations
  - `--ftp-close-timeout 30s` - Longer timeout for data connection closure
  - `--ftp-shut-timeout 30s` - Longer timeout for connection close status

## [0.1.4] - 2026-01-12

### Fixed

- Delete button in connection settings now works (replaced blocked `confirm()` with VS Code native dialog)
- Codicons now display correctly when extension is installed from Marketplace (bundled in resources folder)
