# Changelog

All notable changes to the SFTP+ extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.2.7] - 2026-03-17

### Improved

- **🧭 Stable Host Details navigation** — The Details panel now keeps a consistent `Settings > Console > Files` tab order across disconnected, connecting, connected, and disconnecting states.
- **🎯 Clearer tab focus transitions** — Host selection focuses `Settings`, connect/disconnect operations focus `Console`, and the panel switches to `Files` as soon as the mount is available, reducing visual churn during reconnects and new sessions.
- **🏷️ Tighter labels in the Details panel** — Scope and password-source badges now use shorter labels such as `WS`, `GL`, and `SS`, keeping the tab strip and settings form compact.

### Fixed

- **🔌 Disconnect now returns cleanly to Console** — Disconnecting a host no longer leaves the panel visually stuck on `Files`; the Details view now tracks the disconnect transition and restores the expected console focus.
- **🗂️ Files tab icon and readiness feedback** — The `Files` tab now uses a more explicit tree icon and its loading state aligns better with the actual mount readiness, avoiding misleading clicks while the webview is still preparing.

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-17

### Fixed

- **🔁 Prevented UI freeze after mount loss** — The host file browser no longer performs blocking synchronous filesystem reads while rendering, reducing the risk of an unresponsive extension host when a mounted drive becomes unreadable.
- **🧯 Stopped reconnect-related refresh loops** — Connections with `autoReconnectOnDrop` enabled now stop the file browser auto-refresh when the mounted drive starts returning I/O errors, preventing repeated refresh/reload churn against a broken mount.
- **🩺 Better mount failure recovery** — Mount accessibility is now treated as part of connection health, so unreadable drives transition out of the stale `connected` state and can trigger a cleaner reconnect path.

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **🔍 Native Compare for tracked files** — Out-of-sync tracked files can now be opened in a native VS Code diff between the local working copy and the mounted host version.
- **🤖 Review with Agent** — When MCP is active on a host, tracked out-of-sync files now expose a dedicated `Review with Agent` action that opens the local file and asks the active agent to propose reviewable edits against the host version.

### Improved

- **🛡️ Safer sync actions in the file browser** — `Download` is now only offered when the host is newer or the file is not downloaded; `Upload` is only offered when the local tracked file is newer.
- **⚡ Immediate tracked-file refresh** — The host file tree now refreshes tracked statuses as soon as local tracked files are saved, created, or deleted under `.sftp-plus/{connection}/...`.

### Fixed

- **📝 Same-size local edits are now detected correctly** — A local modification that keeps the exact same file size no longer stays falsely `synced`; the tracking logic now detects the change and marks the file `local-newer` or `remote-newer` correctly.

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **🖥️ Host session console** — Each host now has a persistent session console in Details with test/connect/reconnect/disconnect logs kept for the full VS Code session, including separators between runs.
- **🔄 Auto-reconnect on unattended disconnection** — New per-connection option to automatically reconnect when a mounted host drops unexpectedly.
- **⬆️ Upload action in host file browser** — Tracked files marked `local-newer` can now be uploaded directly from the SFTP+ file browser context menu.

### Improved

- **🔐 FTPS certificate recovery UX** — FTPS test/connect flows now classify certificate failures, surface them in the console, and offer an explicit UI path to enable certificate auto-accept.
- **🤖 MCP recovery guidance** — `list_connections` now exposes MCP state, autonomous reconnect availability, and explicit `recoveryAction` / `recoveryHint` fields so the agent can decide whether to reconnect immediately or ask for manual intervention.
- **📊 MCP tool availability after reload** — Language model tools are now registered eagerly at activation, improving discoverability before a host is manually resumed.

### Fixed

- **🛑 Removed hardcoded FTPS certificate bypass** — FTPS mounts no longer skip TLS validation unless `ignoreCertErrors` is explicitly enabled.
- **🔁 Autonomous reconnect after reload** — MCP reconnect can now recover using stored credentials when the in-memory session cache is gone, and temporary drive-drop errors are normalized into reconnect instructions.

## [0.2.3] - 2026-02-23

### Fixed

- **🤖 Agent autonomously reconnects without user intervention** — All `TEMPORARY:` error messages from file operation tools now include `ACTION REQUIRED: Call sftp-plus_reconnect` so the agent acts immediately instead of asking the user.
- **🔄 Reconnect kills stale rclone process first** — Mirrors the UI "Reconnect" button: kills any lingering process before mounting fresh, avoiding drive-letter conflicts.
- **🔑 Reconnect reuses cached password** — No UI password prompt during autonomous reconnection; the obscured password from the active session is reused directly.

## [0.2.2] - 2026-02-22

### Added

- **🔄 New AI Tool: `reconnect`** — Allows the AI agent to autonomously reconnect a dropped SFTP/FTP connection without user intervention, as long as credentials are already stored. The agent can detect a `TEMPORARY:` error from any file operation tool and immediately call `sftp-plus_reconnect` to restore the connection, then retry the operation — enabling fully autonomous multi-step workflows even when the connection is lost mid-task.

### Fixed

- **🔑 Autonomous reconnect actually works** — The previous `reconnect` tool called the same `connect()` path which, when the password was not in SecretStorage (e.g. entered interactively at first connect), would open a UI password prompt and block the agent indefinitely. A dedicated `reconnect()` method now reuses the **obscured password already cached in memory** from the previous session, bypassing the password lookup entirely. Falls back to the normal flow (with potential UI prompt) only if no cached password is available (e.g. after a VS Code restart).

- **🔄 Reconnect now kills stale rclone process first** — Mirrors the UI "Reconnect" button: kills any lingering rclone process before mounting fresh, avoiding drive-letter conflicts.

- **🤖 Agent now knows to call `sftp-plus_reconnect` on its own** — All `TEMPORARY:` error messages from file operation tools now include an explicit `ACTION REQUIRED: Call sftp-plus_reconnect` instruction. The tool `modelDescription` also directs the agent to call it immediately rather than asking the user. Previously the agent had no signal to trigger reconnect autonomously.
